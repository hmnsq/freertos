/*
Changes between V1.2.4 and V1.2.5

    + Introduced portGLOBAL_INTERRUPT_FLAG definition to test the global
      interrupt flag setting.  Using the two bits defined within
      portINITAL_INTERRUPT_STATE was causing the w register to get clobbered
      before the test was performed.

Changes from V1.2.5

    + Set the interrupt vector address to 0x08.  Previously it was at the
      incorrect address for compatibility mode of 0x18.

Changes from V2.1.1

    + PCLATU and PCLATH are now saved as part of the context.  This allows
      function pointers to be used within tasks.  Thanks to Javier Espeche
      for the enhancement.

Changes from V2.3.1

    + TABLAT is now saved as part of the task context.

Changes from V3.2.0

    + TBLPTRU is now initialised to zero as the MPLAB compiler expects this
      value and does not write to the register.

 * Macro that pushes all the registers that make up the context of a task onto

 *
 * If this is called from an ISR then the interrupt enable bits must have been
 * set for the ISR to ever get called.  Therefore we want to save the INTCON
 * register with the enable bits forced to be set - and ucForcedInterruptFlags
 * must contain these bit settings.  This means the interrupts will again be
 * enabled when the interrupted task is switched back in.
 *
 * If this is called from a manual context switch (i.e. from a call to yield),
 * then we want to save the INTCON so it is restored with its current state,
 * and ucForcedInterruptFlags must be 0.  This allows a yield from within
 * a critical section.
 *
 * The compiler uses some locations at the bottom of the memory for temporary
 * storage during math and other computations.  This is especially true if
 * 32bit data types are utilized (as they are by the scheduler).  The .tmpdata
 * and MATH_DATA sections have to be stored in there entirety as part of a task
 * context.  This macro stores from data address 0x00 to
 * portCOMPILER_MANAGED_MEMORY_SIZE.  This is sufficient for the demo
 * applications but you should check the map file for your project to ensure
 * this is sufficient for your needs.  It is not clear whether this size is
 * fixed for all compilations or has the potential to be program specific.
